These frog-like humanoids are uniquely adapted to their environment, with oversized eyes that give them keen vision in both light and dark and large toes that allow them to easily scale trees. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, with their physiologies influenced by their surrounding environment. Those who live in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes. In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled-brown coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and orange stripes. Typical gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately 30 pounds.</p>\n<p>Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don't maintain typical farms like other humanoids do. Rather, they cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. While most gripplis hunt insects, some societies also capture and breed them, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that they eventually slaughter for food. Particularly enterprising gripplis might even seek out and tame larger flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.</p>\n<p>Gripplis usually construct their villages in particularly dense copses, stringing thin rope bridges between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk. They make use of broad leaves and thick branches to further obscure their villages, making them especially difficult to spot from the forest floor, and riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they can navigate.</p>\n<p>Grippli scouts typically keep watch on the outskirts of grippli settlements.

Always eager for mayhem and murder, ogre warriors are quick to turn on their kin when there's a shortage of smaller folk to torment, so those who lead ogres do their best to keep them constantly distracted with new opportunities for raids and ruin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and cruelty. Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids-the smaller and more beautiful, the better-ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre's robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres' playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \"boss\"-usually the family's patriarch or matriarch-while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss's loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["giant","humanoid"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["jotun"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":-1},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":-2},"wis":{"mod":0},"cha":{"mod":-2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":5,"saveDetail":""}}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.gdXok08bITkhowDJ"}},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Ogre Warrior","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"PZ5oX9mudDMzrpJi":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1665844750726,"modifiedTime":1665845005729,"lastModifiedBy":"PZ5oX9mudDMzrpJi"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"nRvudijeCm6aXCkL"}
