slaves.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Gnolls are short, hyena-headed humanoids who dwell in warm grasslands, savannas, and arid hills. Given their appearance, their affinity for hyenas should not be surprising; gnolls share their homes, food, and even many of their own behaviors with these animals. Much like hyenas, gnolls have a notorious reputation-they are known as bloodthirsty gluttons and slavers who worship demons or other reprehensible powers. Though these rumors are often true, the behavior of gnoll clans varies widely. Some groups are composed of capable hunters who rarely clash with other humanoids unless there is a conflict over territory. Others hew closer to the unsavory stories, preferring to raid settlements and enslave innocents, snatching the fruits of others' hard labor by strength of arms and forcing their victims to perform the hard, demeaning labor necessary to maintain the brutal clan.</p>\n<p>Gnolls lack any particular reverence for the remains of the dead, which adds to their reputation as scavengers or even cannibals. They willingly eat nearly any other creature, including dead gnolls, which can evoke strong reactions from people and cultures with a strong taboo against cannibalism or desecrating the dead. To a gnoll, it is almost more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its origin; gnolls see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the flesh of a dead gnoll, which they consider an insult to that gnoll's memory and sacrifice and an implication that the gnoll's flesh is unworthy of consumption. In fact, they refuse to eat the bodies of particularly hated foes; particularly warmongering gnolls even spike the bodies or heads of such despised enemies on tall spears, which they place around their tribal holdings to dishonor the dead and intimidate would-be invaders.</p>\n<p>Gnoll women are far stronger and more aggressive than gnoll men and are typically considered the leaders of their hunting packs and clans. Though gnolls tend to be disorganized when it comes to practical matters or negotiations, they are extremely efficient at working together to hunt down prey or overwhelm a group of foes. Much like hyenas, they prefer to hunt in packs, and are exceptionally skilled at setting up ambushes or separating individual targets from larger groups.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["gnoll","humanoid"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["gnoll"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":-1},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":8,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""}}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.o3DRwRKeJrl83Wv9"}},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Gnoll Hunter","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"n0dJuouTB3ZeUAOI":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1665798874732,"modifiedTime":1665798874732,"lastModifiedBy":"n0dJuouTB3ZeUAOI"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"NrGciNDGOfi8yWwr"}

Some scout alone to make the most of their stealth, but others form groups for the sake of safety.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>These distant cousins to gnomes are reclusive, underground dwellers. Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement.</p>\n<p>The first deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey who might infiltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons for the gnomes' relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep gnome of today.</p>\n<p>Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at first glance, they retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require to process their feelings.</p>\n<p>Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby duergar communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor duergars are particularly proud of these conflicts, but both insist they were in the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars fight has left a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities, leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even more than other strangers. This can result in non-duergar dwarves being driven off from deep gnome cities before being able to explain themselves. A dwarf and even those traveling with a dwarf require patience and tenacity when attempting to deal with deep gnomes holding such views.</p>\n<p>Svirfneblins value crafting and many decorate their cavernous homes with paintings on the walls, often incorporating the rock in clever ways. They also value crystals and gems, making jewelry and beads that they string through their hair.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["gnome","humanoid"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["gnomish","undercommon"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"},"ci":[]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":2},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":0},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":-1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":5,"saveDetail":""}}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.9FZMzpAu4XhCI0IB"}},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Deep Gnome Scout","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"n0dJuouTB3ZeUAOI":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1665799004800,"modifiedTime":1665799004800,"lastModifiedBy":"n0dJuouTB3ZeUAOI"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"amq2Dhis3MyLLSgV"}
